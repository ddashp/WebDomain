        <h2>Amusement #1</h2>
        <p>For amusement #1 I am choosing to a fantasy football stat page. I know, I know, this probably isn't amusing to most of you. However, given the theme of my page, I wanted to start with this. It is very amusing to me because week in and week out I study stats of players to help me decide who to start in my fantasy leagues each week. </p>

        <h2>Amusemnet #2</h2>
        <p>For this one, I am choosing to send you to a video of football bloopers! This has a ton of content from the early days of football, which makes it even more amusing! Look how far we have come. </p>

        <h2>Amusement #3</h2>
        <p>For my final amusement I am taking you to a video where you can watch the greatest football catches of all time! Some of the best receivers in the history of football making some of the best catches we have ever seen. How could you not like that?</p>
