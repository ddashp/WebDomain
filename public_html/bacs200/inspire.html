        <p>When I think about who inspires me, a few people come to mind. The person that really stuck for me was Pat Tillman. For those of you who have not heard of Pat Tillman, he was one of the most patriotic athletes that this country has ever seen. He played in the NFL, and was an excellent football player. He had it all, as you know NFL players make a lot of money. However, Pat was so patriotic and believed in this country and it's freedoms, so he left the NFL to enlist in the U.S. Army in 2002 just after his fourth season as an Arizona Cardinal. Most people didn't understand why he would leave him million dollar job playing football to join the army. He was thinking bigger than football. He was wanting to help protect the freedom that we all have as a citizen in the United States. Sadly, in 2004, he was killed in Afghanistan fighting for our freedom. He could of stayed in the NFL and made millions of dollars playing a sport he loved, but instead made the ultimate sacrifice for our counrty. Pat Tillman is such an inspiration to many Americans, as he put everyone before himself in his decisions. </p>
